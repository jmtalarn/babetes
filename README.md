##Ghost
> Just a blogging platform
**Ghost** is a simple, powerful publishing platform that allows you to share your stories with the world.

When you open it you feel ready and focused to write thanks to its excellent user interface centered in the writing experience. I'm not yet fully get used to markdown language but it's only a matter of practice.
In the backend I also feel really confident with the development technology, the theme development is well structured and defined to be changed and improved.
